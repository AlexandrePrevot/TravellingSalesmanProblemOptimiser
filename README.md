# Travelling salesman optimizer through Genetic Algorithm

Proposed an algorithm to find solutions close to the optimal to the Travelling Salesman Problem using a GeneticAlgorithm.
- Cross over operator : Edge Recombination cross over
- Mutation operator : Random reverse of segment
- Selection operator : Raw selection of the best X individuals
- Fitness evaluation : take the sum of distance between points

The particularity of this project is that the algorithm is entirely done in C++, but the FE is done in python and display in real time the result.
